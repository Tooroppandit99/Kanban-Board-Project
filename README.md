# Kanban-Board-Project
A Kanban board is a visual project management tool used to track tasks and workflows as they move through different stages, such as To Do, In Progress, and Done.

This is a simple, dynamic Kanban board application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
# Features:

Create and View Cards: Create a card for each task with a title and a description.

# Drag & Drop:
     Easily move cards between columns (e.g., from To Do to In Progress).
     Reorder cards within the same column.
# Persistence:
     All your tasks are automatically saved using localStorage.
     Your tasks remain in their position even after you reload or close the page.
    
# Edit & Delete:
     The ability to directly edit any card's details.
     An option to delete any task with a confirmation prompt.
# Modular Code:
     The code is organized into separate files (main.js, storage.js, task.js) for better readability and maintainability.
     This keeps the code clean and reusable.
